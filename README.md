Put together as part of NYC VR hackathon.

Code is for information purposes only. As in, it's probably buggy.

#### Game Idea

Coins gets placed randomly around the room. You run around and try to get them before the time runs out. If you get the number of coins for the level, you win the level! Coins explode all over the place after the you collect the last coin (Windows solitare style).

#### Implementation

The current Coins World app places coins on tap. When you come close to the coins, it disappears with a pleasing chime.

#### Hackathon result

Won 2nd prize (tied).
